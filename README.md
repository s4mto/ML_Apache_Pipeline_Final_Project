# ML Apache Pipeline Final Project

Its a Data Engineer Assignment for IBM Data Engineer Certificate. What I did for the assignment;

# Scenario
I'm a data engineer at an aeronautics consulting company. My company prides itself in being able to efficiently design airfoils for use in planes and sports cars. Data scientists in my office need to work with different algorithms and data in different formats. While they are good at Machine Learning, they count on you to be able to do ETL jobs and build ML pipelines. In this project I used the modified version of the NASA Airfoil Self Noise dataset. I cleaned this dataset, by dropping the duplicate rows, and removing the rows with null values. I created an ML pipe line to create a model that will predict the SoundLevel based on all the other columns. I evaluated the model and towards the end I persisted the model.

# Objectives
In this 4 part assignment you did:

# Part 1 Perform ETL activity
* Load a csv dataset
* Remove duplicates if any
* Drop rows with null values if any
* Make transformations
* Store the cleaned data in parquet format

# Part 2 Create a Machine Learning Pipeline
* Create a machine learning pipeline for prediction

# Part 3 Evaluate the Model
* Evaluate the model using relevant metrics

# Part 4 Persist the Model
* Save the model for future production use
* Load and verify the stored model

# Datasets
In this lab you will be using dataset(s):
